### Statistical analysis methods in Python
____
This script provides a general algorithmic scheme for choosing a criterion or analysis method and shows step-by-step statistical analysis algorithms for each criterion with code fragments (in various variations) and data examples.

*The script is currently under active development.*<br>
*Main libraries used: pandas, scipy, pingouin, statsmodels.*

#### Contents:<br>
1. Algorithm for statistical analysis
2. Checking the normal distribution
    * Graphical distribution (distplot)
    * Kolmogorov-Smirnov criterion
    * Shapiro-Wilk test
    * QQ-plot
3. Descriptive statistics
    * Mode, median and mean
    * Range, variance and standard deviation
    *boxplot
    * Confidence interval
4. Standardization (Z-transform)
5. Student's t-test for independent samples
6. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
7. Multivariate analysis of variance
    * Two-way analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA)
8. Correlation analysis
    * Pearson, Spearman and Kendall correlation coefficients
9. Regression analysis
    * Regression with one independent variable
    * Value prediction
10. Multiple regression analysis
    * Logistic regression
    * Chart the correlation between all variables in the analysis
11. Cluster analysis
